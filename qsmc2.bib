    abstract = {Standard methods for maximum likelihood parameter estimation in latent variable models rely on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and its Monte Carlo variants. Our approach is different and motivated by similar considerations to simulated annealing; that is we build a sequence of artificial distributions whose support concentrates itself on the set of maximum likelihood estimates. We sample from these distributions using a sequential Monte Carlo approach. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for several applications of the proposed approach.},

    abstract = {In recent years quantum simulation has made great strides, culminating in experiments that existing supercomputers cannot easily simulate. Although this raises the possibility that special purpose analog quantum simulators may be able to perform computational tasks that existing computers cannot, it also introduces a major challenge: certifying that the quantum simulator is in fact simulating the correct quantum dynamics. We provide an algorithm that, under relatively weak assumptions, can be used to efficiently infer the Hamiltonian of a large but untrusted quantum simulator using a trusted quantum simulator. We illustrate the power of this approach by showing numerically that it can inexpensively learn the Hamiltonians for large frustrated Ising models, demonstrating that quantum resources can make certifying analog quantum simulators tractable.},

    abstract = {Unwanted interaction between a quantum system and its fluctuating environment leads to decoherence and is the primary obstacle to establishing a scalable quantum information processing architecture. Strategies such as environmental and materials engineering, quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling can mitigate decoherence, but generally increase experimental complexity. Here we improve coherence in a qubit using real-time Hamiltonian parameter estimation. Using a rapidly converging Bayesian approach, we precisely measure the splitting in a singlet-triplet spin qubit faster than the surrounding nuclear bath fluctuates. We continuously adjust qubit control parameters based on this information, thereby improving the inhomogenously broadened coherence time from tens of nanoseconds to {\textgreater}2 μs. Because the technique demonstrated here is compatible with arbitrary qubit operations, it is a natural complement to quantum error correction and can be used to improve the performance of a wide variety of qubits in both meteorological and quantum information processing applications.},

Examples of these include optimal control theory pulse generation algorithms and the usage of high Q-factor resonators. However, these developments are blocked by current spectrometer designs. This thesis details the design and testing of a new spectrometer with sufficient accuracy, bandwidth, and control to implement these advances. The proposed solution is to use an FPGA-based development board together with custom computer software. This gives access to high-speed analogue inputs and outputs, as well as digital output pins. The spectrometer is then used in two X-band electron spin resonance experiments, showing how the advantages of the system allow for superior results to that possible with the previous equipment. In addition, the setup is used in a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) system where a rabi experiment is performed.},

Condensation uses learned dynamical models, together with visual observations, to propagate the random set over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time.},

We generalize the "add β" estimators that work well for noiseless coins, and we find that these hedged maximum-likelihood (HML) estimators achieve a worst-case risk of O(N −1/2) on noisy coins, in contrast to O(N −1) in the noiseless case. This increased risk is unavoidable and intrinsic to noisy coins, which we demonstrate by numerical construction of minimax estimators. Practically speaking, the minimax criterion is not a good fit for noisy coins - minimax estimators introduce extreme bias in return for slight improvements in the worst-case risk. We introduce a pointwise lower bound on the minimum achievable risk, and use it to show that HML estimators are pretty good. Finally, we survey scientific applications of the noisy coin model in social science, physical science, and quantum information science.},

	abstract = {We discuss simulation-based sequential analysis -- or particle filtering -- in dynamic models, with a primary focus on sequential Bayesian learning about time-varying state vectors and fixed model parameters simultaneously. We discuss a general approach that combines old ideas of smoothing using kernel methods with newer ideas of auxilliary particle filtering. It is shown here that our specific smoothing approaches can interpret and suggest modifications to techniques that add "artificial evolution noise" to fixed model parameters at each time point to address problems of sample attrition and prior:data conflict. Our new approach permits smoothing and regeneration of sample points of model parameters without the "loss of historical information" inherent in earlier methods; this is achieved using shrinkage modifications of kernel smoothing, as introduced by the second author in the early 1990s. Following some theoretical development, discussion and a small simulated example to demonstrate its efficacy, we report some experiences in using the method in a challenging application in multivariate dynamic factor models for financial time series, as recently studied using straight {MCMC} methods by the second author and other collaborators. Some summary comments and comparisons with {MCMC} methods are given in this applied context.},
